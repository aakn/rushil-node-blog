I'm currently a graduate student studying at Texas A&M University in the Department of Visualization a.k.a The Viz Lab
I've been interested in the field of Animation and Visual Effects for many years now. I began taking an interest in this field at the age of 13. The third Harry Potter movie was due to release back then, and I remember watching the post-production process and was left awestruck. The way computer graphics changed the look of the film significantly and added a whole new dimension to it just made me think one thing - "thatâ€™s what I want to do". Since then, there has been no turning back.
I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science & Engineering in 2013, and it was in my senior year that I began a rigourous process of self-study to gain more knowledge and insight in the wonderful world of Animation and Visual Effects. 
My main areas of interest would be FX (obviously), programming, and procedural modeling.
A lot of things I love begin with the letter 'F', namely:
* Family
* Friends
* FX
* Food
* Football (or...soccer...blegh)
* netFlix (just go with it, alright?)
I support Liverpool FC. I am proud to say it. There might not be a league title to brag about for 20+ years but I'm still a Red, through and through. 
I also enojy gaming. I fall in the Playstation legion of supporters.
I love music. I do not have any preference towards genre. Weird right? 
I enjoy playing football, racquetball and basketball.
Some more fun facts:
I need to have my car radio volume set either in (1) multiples of 5 or (2) multiples of 2.
I am an expert in swearing at my computer when it doesn't obey me.
I love cats AND dogs.
If I could be a superhero I'd probably choose the Human Torch from Fantastic 4.
I only drink tea or coffee on rare occasions, but I love chocolate milk.
I love dirt bikes.
