                                I'm currently working at HERE Technologies as a 
                                Software Engineer. I've worked on multiple projects 
                                including developing features for their in-house 3D 
                                rendering engine and their proprietary city development
                                3D software.
                                Previously, I interned with SideFX Software in Santa 
                                Monica, and Framestore in New York, where I got to
                                work on multiple commercial projects and some animated
                                shorts.
                                I recieved my Master's degree in 2017 from the Visualization 
                                program at Texas A&M University, College Station. 
                                I hold a Bachelors degree in Computer Science & 
                                Engineering.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I've been interested in Computer Graphics from a young
                                age after seeing how movies and video games were made.
                                While I was originally interested in being involved with 
                                3D production for movies, my focus changed to graphics
                                development while in graduate school after attending multiple
                                talks and presentations done by engineers from Pixar and 
                                Disney animation studios during SIGGRAPH one year.
                                My programming language of choice is C++. I'm comfortable 
                                working with OpenGL and GLSL. Recently, I have been working
                                with Python quite a bit.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My main areas of interest are rendering and simulation.
                                I'm also doing my best to keep up with all the technical 
                                innovations being made in the AR and autonomous driving spaces,
                                as I believe these will be parts of our future.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                On the production side, I enjoy working with Houdini. 
                                I like the procedural nature of it, as opposed to the 
                                workflow adopted in other 3D content creation software. 
                                I love working on environmental effects since the vast 
                                number of natural phenomena in our world gives me the 
                                opportunity to simulate something different each time 
                                I pick up a new project to work on.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I have dabbled with Unity and Unreal game engines.
                                I also enjoy doing some light web programming occasionally.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I love football (soccer) and support 
                                <span class="liverpool">Liverpool FC</span>. 
                                They've been a mainstay in my life since 2005. 
                                In my honest, humble opinion, there is no other team
                                worth supporting.
                                In 2015, I finally got to visit the city of Liverpool 
                                and also take a tour of Anfield, Liverpool's home stadium. 
                                It was one of the most memorable experiences of my life.
                            </p>
