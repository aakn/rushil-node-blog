                            I'm a FX Technical Director, and I'm currently a graduate student studying at Texas A&M University in the Department of Visualization a.k.a The Viz Lab. I hold a Bachelors degree in Computer Science & Engineering and have always had a keen interest in Computer Graphics.<br><br>

                        My main area of interest is Effects. I enjoy working with Houdini, even though I'm still learning. I find it highly frustrating,  extremely rewarding, and also a bit addictive. My programming language of choice is C++. I love working on environmental effects since the vast number of natural phenomena in our world gives me the opportunity to simulate something different each time I pick up a new project to work on.<br><br>

                        I also find work related to proceduralism to be very interesting. I have recently begun reading into rendering topics a bit more deeply as well. I consider web and graphic design to be a hobby.<br><br>

                        I also like football (soccer) and support Liverpool FC.<br><br>

                        My time here at the Viz Lab has been wonderful so far. I've had the pleasure of meeting and hanging out with some truly gifted individuals here and I'm enjoying each and every minute of it.

                        Hey there! I'm Rushil Kekre, a FX Technical Director, and I'm currently a graduate student studying at Texas A&M University in the Department of Visualization a.k.a The Viz Lab.<br><br>

I've been interested in the field of Animation and Visual Effects for many years now. I began taking an interest in this field at the age of 13. The third Harry Potter movie was due to release back then, and I remember watching the post-production process and was left awestruck. The way computer graphics changed the look of the film significantly, and added a whole new dimension to it just made me think one thing - "thatâ€™s what I want to do". Since then, there has been no turning back.<br><br>

I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science & Engineering in 2013, and it was in my senior year that I began a rigourous process of self-study to gain more knowledge and insight in the wonderful world of Visual Effects.  After that I took the next big step in my life, and another major step in fulfiling my dream, when I moved to College Station, Texas. I've had the pleasure of meeting and hanging out with some truly gifted individuals here and I'm enjoying each and every minute of it.<br><br>

My main areas of interest would be Effects (well..obviously), physically based simulation programming, and procedural modeling.
